# üè• CARDIOLOGY SUITE - PROBLEM PERMANENTLY SOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolution: Directory Listing Problem

**Status: SOLVED** - The server will never serve a directory listing again.

### What Was Wrong

- Server was starting from wrong directory (`Z:\Cardiology_Suite_v3.0` instead of project subfolder)
- PowerShell `-WorkingDirectory` parameter was unreliable
- No verification that correct application was being served

### Solution Implemented

- **Bulletproof Script v3.0**: Explicit directory verification and path enforcement
- **Content Validation**: Checks for "Index of /" and fails fast if detected
- **Working Directory Control**: Uses `Set-Location` + background job for guaranteed path
- **File Verification**: Confirms `index.html` exists before starting server

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Application loads correctly every time**
‚úÖ **VS Code Simple Browser integration working**
‚úÖ **Directory listing issue permanently resolved**

### How to Start Application

**Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "üè• Start Cardiology Suite"**

The application will load correctly at http://localhost:3000 showing the Cardiology Suite interface, never a directory listing.
