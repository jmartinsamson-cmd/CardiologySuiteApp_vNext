# Clinical Governance & Maintenance

## Overview

The Modern Cardiac Suite is a clinical decision support tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in cardiovascular care. This document outlines the governance framework ensuring clinical accuracy, safety, and regulatory compliance.

## Guideline Review Cadence

### Monthly Review Process

**Schedule:** First Monday of each month
**Duration:** 2-hour dedicated review session
**Participants:** Clinical review team, technical maintainers

#### Review Checklist

1. **Guideline Updates**
   - [ ] Check AHA/ACC guideline updates
   - [ ] Review ESC guideline changes
   - [ ] Verify Canadian Cardiovascular Society updates
   - [ ] Cross-reference with local institutional guidelines

2. **Content Accuracy**
   - [ ] Validate decision tree pathways
   - [ ] Update medication dosing recommendations
   - [ ] Verify calculator algorithms (TIMI, GRACE, Wells)
   - [ ] Review diagnostic criteria changes

3. **Technical Updates**
   - [ ] Update "Last reviewed" timestamps in `utils/cardiac-guidelines.js`
   - [ ] Commit guideline version changes with detailed changelog
   - [ ] Tag releases with guideline version references
   - [ ] Update documentation with change rationales

### Quarterly Deep Review

**Schedule:** End of each quarter
**Focus:** Comprehensive clinical validation and safety review

- Systematic review of all clinical pathways
- Literature search for emerging evidence
- Clinical outcome validation where available
- User feedback incorporation

## Content Management

### "Last Reviewed" Implementation

All clinical content includes timestamp tracking via `utils/cardiac-guidelines.js`:

````javascript
// Example structure
const guidelines = {
  acs: {
    lastReviewed: "2024-10-02",
    version: "AHA/ACC 2023 Guidelines",
    reviewer: "Clinical Team",
    nextReview: "2024-11-01"
  }
};
