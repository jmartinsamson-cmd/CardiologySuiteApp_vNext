Pt reports he has been having increased secretions over the past week causing him to wake up from his sleep short of breath. He states his secretions have also been thicker causing him to have mucus plug offs for around three days. Pt reports he was treated for pneumonia and finished his last dose of antibiotics yesterday. Pt states today an episode where he woke up short of breath happened, however he does not remember exactly what happened and thinks he may have passed out. Per triage note, nursing home staff called an ambulance for respiratory distress, and was placed on 6 lpm trach collar. Pt reports he uses 2 lpm at home. Pt denies any shortness of breath, fever, and reports no other complaints at this time.\n \nPer nursing home - patient finished IV linezolid course several days ago\n\nReview of patient's allergies indicates:\nAllergen\tReactions\n•\tDextromethorphan\t \n \nPast Medical History:\nDiagnosis\tDate\n•\tBacteremia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae\t \n•\tCAD (coronary artery disease)\t \n•\tDDD (degenerative disc disease), cervical\t \n•\tDM (diabetes mellitus), type 2\t \n•\tFatty liver\t \n•\tGERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\t \n•\tGout, unspecified\t \n•\tHLD (hyperlipidemia)\t \n•\tHTN (hypertension)\t \n•\tHyperthyroidism\t \n•\tOSA (obstructive sleep apnea)\t \n•\tSCC (squamous cell carcinoma)\t \n \nReview of Systems \nConstitutional:  Negative for chills and fever. \nHENT:  Positive for congestion.

The largest is in paratracheal space and measures 13.3 mm in least dimension. This suggests lymphadenopathy.\nHeart: The heart size is within normal limits. Moderate coronary artery calcification is seen.\nAorta: No aortic dissection or aneurysm is seen. Mild aortic calcification is seen in the thoracic aorta.\nPulmonary Arteries: No filling defects are seen in the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.\nLungs: There are scattered patchy ground glass opacities throughout both lungs. . There are small left-greater-than-right bilateral pleural effusions. There are large areas of consolidation including in the bilateral medial lung bases. A small calcified granuloma is seen in the right lower lobe seen on series 2 image 79.\nBony Structures:\nSpine: Moderate spondylolytic changes are seen in the thoracic spine.\nRibs: No rib fractures are identified.\nAbdomen: Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant suggesting prior cholecystectomy. A gastrostomy tube is seen with its tip in the stomach.\n \n \nImpression:\n1. A few enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are seen in the lower paratracheal . The largest is in paratracheal space and measures 13.3 mm in least dimension. This suggests lymphadenopathy. Correlate with clinical and laboratory findings as regards further evaluation and follow up.\n2. There are scattered patchy ground glass opacities throughout both lungs. . There are small left-greater-than-right bilateral pleural effusions. There are large areas of consolidation including in the bilateral medial lung bases. This is consistent with multilobar pneumonia. Correlate with clinical and laboratory parameters.\n3. No filling defects are seen in the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.\n \nMedications\nvancomycin - pharmacy to dose\npiperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 4.5 g in D5W 100 mL IVPB (MB+)\nvancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in D5W 250 mL IVPB (admixture device)\npiperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 4.5 g in D5W 100 mL IVPB (MB+)\ninsulin aspart U-100 injection 0-10 Units\nondansetron injection 4 mg\n \nMedical Decision Making\n65 yo with SCC, CAD, HTN, HLD presenting with cough, sob, increased trach collar requirements \nRecently finished treatment for pneumonia at nursing home per report\nExam as above\nWorkup reveals multifocal pneumonia\nWill admit for IV abx, respiratory suctioning prn\n \nDifferential diagnosis (including but not limited to): \nACS, pneumonia, COVID/Flu, congestive heart failure, asthma, COPD, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, acute bronchitis, PE, pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic dissection, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, anxiety \n \n \nProblems Addressed:\nPneumonia of both lower lobes due to infectious organism: acute illness or injury that poses a threat to life or bodily functions\nSOB (shortness of breath): acute illness or injury that poses a threat to life or bodily functions",
