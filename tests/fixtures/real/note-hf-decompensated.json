  "input": "HPI: \n53 year old man with history of HFrEF, NIDDM, CKD stage 3B, morbid obesity and hypertension presents for 2 week history of progressively worsening SOB and abdominal swelling. Endorses weight gain but unable to quantify. Denies fever, CP, vomiting or diarrhea. ECHO done 6/26/25 showed LVEF 35-40%. Admits to running out of most of his medications several months ago, including Entresto and synthroid. Compliant with Lasix. Endorses not following cardiac or diabetic diet. Diastolic reading are high but overall VS stable. Requiring 2L/NC to keep sats > 95%. Initial labs include BUN 22.5, creatinine 2.45 (baseline around 2.0). BNP 6,231. Troponin normal. Chest x-ray shows cardiac enlargement with central vascular congestion.  Admitted to hospital medicine service for further evaluation and management of acute on chronic heart failure.  \n \nCardiology was consulted.  IV diuresis was continued. Will consult nephrology also. \n \nInterval Hx: \nSeen and examined. LE edema improving. Still complaining of abdominal distension. Continues on room air.
