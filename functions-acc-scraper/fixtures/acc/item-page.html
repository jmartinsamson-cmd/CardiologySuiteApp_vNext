        <h2>Study Summary</h2>
        <p>
          This multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of 
          high-intensity statin therapy in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events 
          (MACE) compared to moderate-intensity therapy in patients with established 
          coronary artery disease.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>20% relative risk reduction in MACE with high-intensity therapy</li>
          <li>LDL-C levels reduced by an additional 25 mg/dL on average</li>
          <li>No significant increase in adverse events including myalgia</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Clinical Implications</h2>
        <p>
          These findings support the use of high-intensity statin therapy as first-line 
          treatment for secondary prevention in patients with established cardiovascular disease.
        </p>

        <h2>Study Details</h2>
        <p>
          The trial enrolled 5,234 patients across 127 centers in North America and Europe. 
          Median follow-up was 3.2 years. Primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular 
          death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
